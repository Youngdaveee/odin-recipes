          <li>Plum tomatoes</li>
          <li>Red bell peppers</li>
          <li>Scotch bonnet peppers</li>
          <li>Vegetable oil</li>
          <li>Tomato paste</li>
          <li>Chicken stock or broth</li>
          <li>Curry powder</li>

          <li>Bay leaves</li>
          <li>Salt and Maggi</li>
       </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol>
          <li><strong>Prepare the base:</strong> Blend the tomatoes, red bell peppers, scotch bonnets
        until smooth.</li>
          <li><strong>Saute the Aromatics:</strong> Heat vegetable oil in a large pot and fry sliced
        onions until they are soft and golden.</li>
          <li><strong>Fry the Paste:</strong> Add the tomato paste to the onions and fry for several minutes
        to deepen the flavor and remove the tanginess.</li>
          <li><strong>Cook the Sauce:</strong> Pour in the blended pepper mix. Cook it down until the water
        evaporates and the oil starts to rise to the top.</li>
          <li><strong>Season:</strong> Stir in chicken stock, curry powder, thyme, bay leaves, salt, and 
        Maggi cubes. Bring everything to a boil.</li>
          <li><strong>Add the rice:</strong> Wash your parboiled rice thoroughly, add to the pot, and stir.
        Ensure the liquid is hjust slightly above the rice level.</li>
          <li><strong>Steam:</strong> Cover the pot slightly. Cook on the low heat until the rice is tender
        and the liquid is fully absorbed.</li>
          <li><strong>The "Smoky" Finish:</strong> Once done, turn up the heat for the last minute to slightly
         burn the bottom for that classy party-style smoky flavor.</li>
